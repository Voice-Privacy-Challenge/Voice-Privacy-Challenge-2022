# Recipe for VoicePrivacy Challenge 2022

## Under construction...

Please visit the [challenge website](https://www.voiceprivacychallenge.org/) for more information about the Challenge.


## Install

1. `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Voice-Privacy-Challenge/Voice-Privacy-Challenge-2022.git`
2. ./install.sh

## Running the recipe

The recipe uses the pre-trained models of anonymization. To run the baseline system with evaluation:

1. `cd baseline`
2. run `./run.sh`. In run.sh, to download models and data the user will be requested the password which is provided during the Challenge registration.

## General information

For more details about the baseline and data, please see [The VoicePrivacy 2020 Challenge Evaluation Plan](https://www.voiceprivacychallenge.org/vp2020/docs/VoicePrivacy_2020_Eval_Plan_v1_3.pdf)

For the latest updates in the baseline and evaluation scripts, please visit [News and updates page](https://github.com/Voice-Privacy-Challenge/Voice-Privacy-Challenge-2020/wiki/News-and-Updates)

To participate in the **VoicePrivacy 2022 Challenge** and get access to evaluation datasets and models, please send an email to organisers@lists.voiceprivacychallenge.org with “VoicePrivacy-2022" as the subject line. The mail body should include: 

* (i) the name of the team; 
* (ii) the name of the contact person; 
* (iii) their affiliation;
* (iv) their country; 
* (v) their status (academic/nonacademic).

## Data

#### Training data
The dataset for anonymization system traing consists of subsets from the following corpora*:
* [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12/) - train-clean-100, train-other-500
* [LibriTTS](http://www.openslr.org/60/) - train-clean-100, train-other-500
* [VoxCeleb 1 & 2](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/) - all

*only specified subsets of these corpora can be used for training.

#### Development and evaluation data
* [VCTK](https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3443) - subsets vctk_dev and vctk_test are download from server in run.sh
* [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12/) - subsets libri_dev and libri_test are download from server in run.sh


##  Baseline-1: Anonymization  using x-vectors and neural waveform models 

This is the primary (default) baseline.

### Models

The baseline system uses several independent models:
1. ASR acoustic model to extract BN features (`1_asr_am`) - trained on LibriSpeech-train-clean-100 and LibriSpeech-train-other-500
2. X-vector extractor (`2_xvect_extr`) - trained on VoxCeleb 1 & 2.
3. Speech synthesis (SS) acoustic model (`3_ss_am`) - trained on LibriTTS-train-clean-100.
4. Neural source filter (NSF) model (`4_nsf`) - trained on LibriTTS-train-clean-100.

All the pretrained models are provided as part of this baseline (downloaded by ./baseline/local/download_models.sh)


##  Baseline-2: Anonymization using McAdams coefficient

This is an additional baseline.

To run: `./run.sh --mcadams true`

It does not require any training data and is based upon simple signal processing techniques using the McAdams coefficient.



## Results

The result file with all the metrics and all datasets for submission will be generated in: ./baseline/exp/results-`date`-`time`/results.txt

Please see 
* [RESULTS for Baseline-1](https://github.com/Voice-Privacy-Challenge/Voice-Privacy-Challenge-2020/blob/master/baseline/RESULTS_baseline)
